        {
          "q": "What happens if an adapter fails?",
          "a": "The system automatically falls back to default HTML scraping. Adapters enhance but never break the default behavior."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I share adapters with other users?",
          "a": "You can copy the adapter JSON, but it may not work on other instances if website structures differ or if the website serves different content."
        },
        {
          "q": "How often should I update adapters?",
          "a": "If websites change their structure, discover fresh adapters. Old adapters are kept for backward compatibility but may become unreliable."
        },
        {
          "q": "Why is JavaScript discovery so slow?",
          "a": "JavaScript discovery launches a real browser (Chromium) to render JavaScript dynamically, which takes 3-5 seconds per page."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can adapters break my default scraping?",
          "a": "No, adapters only enhance scraping. If an adapter fails, the system falls back to default scraping automatically."
        },
        {
          "q": "What's the best confidence score?",
          "a": "80% or higher is considered good. Scores below 70% indicate less reliable detection and may require manual verification."
        },
        {
          "q": "How are PDFs matched to domains?",
